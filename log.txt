Debugging and getting the plenoirf simualtion chain up and running again.
It seems something is wrong with the timing of the cherenkov-bunches
which are given to the merlict-ray-tracer. The signals are too spread
out in the light-field camera and thus no trigger occurs. Adding more
unittests to verify the transformation of Cherenkov bunches.

Prepare storing paths to executables in user's configfiles. Fix bugs in
install.py. Include the phantom_source as a submodule. For some reason
this was never done despite the phantom_source having its own
repository. Make plenoirf, magnetic_deflection, and plenoptics adopt
the implicit lookup of executable paths.

Rename corsika_install to coriska_primary to be more consistent with the
python package name.

2024-02-14 v1.9.1
Overhaul 'install.py' Prepare to store executable paths in config files
inside the user's home. Change license to CC-BY-4.0.

2024-02-14 v1.9.0
Restructure 'starter_kit'. Put packes into seperate directory.
Remove obsolete examples. Move scripts i.e. code which is not yet a package
into packages/scripts. The fermi_lat/ directory is a collection of scripts
related to Fermi-Lat so we move it to packages/scripts
