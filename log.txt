It seems we found the cause of the timing issue with the cherenkov light.
Both the corika_primary package and the merlict_development_kit
interpret the cherenkov bunches directions to be the momentum. U and V.
And this makes sense as it is also defined as such in the CORSIKA 7.56
manual in table 11 and figure 1 on page 108. This is why the simualtion
so far worked out fine.
BUTT, in between I forgot about this definition and interpreted the
cherenkov bunches direction as the incident direction. This mirrors the
direction. Based on this mistake, I created test and calibration sources
and implemented the transformation of cherenkov bunches which is crucial
to the pointing of the plenoscope. Since my mistake was implemented in
calibration sources and inside the tests, it looked that all
transformations run as expected when in reality it was different from
CORSIKA's definition. Anyhow, now I try to tidy up this mess by removing
the corsika_primary.I.BUNCH.CX_RAD and CY_RAD. This is plain wrong.
Actually it is CORSIKA's U and V defined in the manual in Table 11.
This effects vast parts of the code.

Debugging and getting the plenoirf simualtion chain up and running again.
It seems something is wrong with the timing of the cherenkov-bunches
which are given to the merlict-ray-tracer. The signals are too spread
out in the light-field camera and thus no trigger occurs. Adding more
unittests to verify the transformation of Cherenkov bunches.

Prepare storing paths to executables in user's configfiles. Fix bugs in
install.py. Include the phantom_source as a submodule. For some reason
this was never done despite the phantom_source having its own
repository. Make plenoirf, magnetic_deflection, and plenoptics adopt
the implicit lookup of executable paths.

2004-02-17 v1.9.2
Rename corsika_install to coriska_primary to be more consistent with the
python package name.

2024-02-14 v1.9.1
Overhaul 'install.py' Prepare to store executable paths in config files
inside the user's home. Change license to CC-BY-4.0.

2024-02-14 v1.9.0
Restructure 'starter_kit'. Put packes into seperate directory.
Remove obsolete examples. Move scripts i.e. code which is not yet a package
into packages/scripts. The fermi_lat/ directory is a collection of scripts
related to Fermi-Lat so we move it to packages/scripts
