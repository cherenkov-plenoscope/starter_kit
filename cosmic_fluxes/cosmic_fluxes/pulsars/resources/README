This folder contains the pulsar profiles for each pulsar from the Fermi LAT pubulicaitons: "Jname.txt/png" files

TheSEDpulsars.dat contains the SED information form the 2nd Fermi LAT catalog, which contains 117pulsars. So this catalog is incomplete, some pulsar may not be able to find here
The SED file heads are :|name           |ra        |dec      |period|pdot     |photon_index|cutoff (MeV) |plec1_pref (cm^-2/s/MeV)|plec1_scaling_energy(MeV)|plec1_cutoff(MeV) the same as cutoff|
you can check this from Eq. 12 of the paper https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/208/2/17 
and the website for the meaning and units
